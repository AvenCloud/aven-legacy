# Build Incrementally

Our best way to move fast is to ship small changes to our products as quickly as possible. By doing so, we can present progress and get immediate feedback on the outcome of our work.

## Use a Roadmap

Be sure to plan ahead and have a clear idea of what you'd like to fix or change. Each change may be tiny and inconsequential, which is fine if you know where you're going.

## Add then Subtract

When struggling to build something in an incremental way, consider what you could add to the existing project. You can then verify the new feature has the desired effect, and switch over to it.

Leave the legacy feature in place until the new feature is fully tested and settled. Then you can delete it.
