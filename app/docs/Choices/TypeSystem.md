Currently on broken JS type system

Avoid bolt-on JS type systems like flow and TS

Avoid GraphQL because its type system cannot natively be used by client and server language.

Avoid relational DB tables because columns are essentially types.

Long term plan is to migrate to ReasonML and deprecate JS.
